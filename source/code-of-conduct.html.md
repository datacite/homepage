# DataCite Code of Conduct

### Event Guidelines


DataCite is committed to ensuring our events are welcoming, productive, and safe and foster open dialogue, encourage the exchange of ideas, promote equal opportunities and treatment for all participants, and are free of harassment and discrimination. All participants are expected to treat others with respect and consideration and we kindly ask participants to alert DataCite staff of any inappropriate situations or anyone in distress.

The following guidelines apply to all attendees, speakers, staff, contractors, volunteers, partners and guests at all DataCite online and in person events.

The following represent types of behaviors that are not acceptable during DataCite events:

- engaging in biased, demeaning, intimidating, coercive, harassing, or hostile conduct or commentary, whether seriously or in jest, based on race, gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, profession, national origin, ethnicity, or religion
- engaging in personal attacks of any kind
- retaliation against reporting of conduct concerns or assisting in conflict resolution
- disruption of events (e.g., “Zoom-bombing”) or engaging in harm or threats of harm of any kind
- engaging in any of the above behaviors on social media in relation to DataCite events

Participants that are asked to stop any misconduct are expected to comply immediately. Anyone violating this Code of Conduct will be expelled from the event and may be blocked from attending any future events.

We thank the community for your help in keeping DataCite events an open,  welcoming, respectful, and friendly space for all participants.

### Reporting Harassment/Misconduct

All reports will be treated confidentially.
