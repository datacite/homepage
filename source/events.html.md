# Upcoming DataCite Webinars 

## After Make Data Count: the building blocks of data metrics - Wednesday, May 28, 2019 17:00 - 18:00 CET 

During the last 2 years a lot of work took place within the Make Data Count project to take the first steps towards data
metrics. Now that MDC has come to an end, we would like to show you what infrastructure DataCite has available as a result of
the project. We will demo how you can contribute usage stats and citations and show the different ways in which we're sharing
these numbers with the community. There will also be plenty of time to discuss next steps.

## Repository Implementation Webinar - Wednesday, March 26, 2019, 17:00-18.00 CET

Join us on March 26th at 17.00 CET for a webinar on repository implementation of our COUNTER Code of Practice
for Research Data and Make Data Count recommendations. This webinar will feature a panel of developers from repositories
that have implemented or are about to release standardized data metrics: Dataverse, Dryad, and Zenodo. We will interview
each repository on their implementation process. This recorded discussion between our technical team and repositories,
providing various perspectives of implementation, should be a helpful guidance for any repository interested in
implementing!

## Google Dataset Search - Wednesday, November 28, 2018, 17:00-18:00 CET

Dataset Search enables users to find datasets across thousands of repositories on the web. They range from various 
scientific disciplines, such as environmental or social science, to government or economic data from around the world. 
I will discuss the ideas behind Dataset Search, the open ecosystem for describing and citing datasets that we hope 
to encourage, and the technical details on how we went about building Dataset Search.

and is a Board-certified medical oncologist.

## Software Citation Principles - 	Monday, November 14, 2016, 16:00-17:00 CET

Daniel S. Katz (Assistant Director for Scientific Software and Applications at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, University of Illinois) will talk about the FORCE 11 Software Citation Principles, their implementation and impact.

Smith AM, Katz DS, Niemeyer KE, FORCE11 Software Citation Working Group. (2016) Software Citation Principles. PeerJ Computer Science 2:e86. [http://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.86](http://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.86).

Software is a critical part of modern research and yet there is little support across the scholarly ecosystem for its acknowledgement and citation. The FORCE11 Software Citation Working Group reviewed the existing community practices and produced a consolidated set of citation principles that may encourage broad adoption of a consistent policy for software citation across disciplines and venues. 

This webinar will cover the software citation principles, existing community practice, requirements for different stakeholders and possible technical solutions for how these principles can be implemented.

## Dynamic Data Citation Webinar - Tuesday, July 12th, 2016 at 5:00 PM CEST

There is a strong need for data identification and citation mechanisms that identify arbitrary subsets of 
large data sets with precision in a machine-actionable way. These mechanisms need to be user-friendly,
transparent, machine-actionable, scalable and applicable to various static and dynamic data types.

The Research Data Alliance (RDA) Dynamic Data Citation Working Group developed a set of recommendations based 
on dynamic resolution of a datacitation via a time-stamped query also known as 'Dynamic Data Citation'.
They cover:

* Data Versioning
* Data Timestamping
* Data Identification

More information: [https://rd-alliance.org/group/data-citation-wg/outcomes/data-citation-recommendation.html](https://rd-alliance.org/group/data-citation-wg/outcomes/data-citation-recommendation.html).

#### Speaker: Andreas Rauber

Dr. Andreas Rauber (Institute of Software Technology and Interactive Systems, Vienna University of Technology) 
co-chairs the RDA Data Citation WG. In this session, he will guide us through the results of the WG and the 
Recommendations for Dynamic Data Citation.
