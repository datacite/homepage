# Membership Fees

DataCite's strength is rooted in its active membership. Our global community of like-minded organizational Members includes data centers, libraries, government agencies, research institutions and more. Members are the voting body of the organization and establish our vision and strategy, set our fee structure, and vote or stand for our Executive Board. Membership is open to all organizations that share our research sharing mission. Membership fees support DataCite’s goal of making all research outputs a critical component of the research landscape.

This fee applies to Member-only organizations, non-profit and for-profit Direct Members, and to a Consortium as a whole.

# DOI Service Fees

DataCite’s DOI Services are available to Members for an additional service fee. Our robust infrastructure provides a simple and effective method of DOI creation and management thereby enabling discovery, access, sharing, tracking, and citation. DataCite’s user-facing services -- indexed content, help-desk, support site, and a metadata schema –support a range of diverse content types (data, text, images, software, workflows, and more).

## DOI Service Fees for Non‐profit Organizations

Each non-profit Direct Member or Consortium Organization that makes use of DOI registration services will pay an annual service fee. This fee consists of an Organization fee and tier based DOI registration fee:

#### Organization Fee

The organization fee is 500€. This fee includes all the repositories and prefixes needed by an organization to follow best practices.

#### DOI Fee

There are several tiers of for the number of new DOIs registered annually. The tiers accommodate different types of organizations and align with the cost impact supporting the DataCite infrastructure. Within a Consortium we calculate the DOI fee per organization, but there is one total DOI fee across all repositories of an organization. The DOI fee is based on the total number of DOIs registered in the previous calendar year. In the first year the DOI fee is based on an estimate of DOIs the organization is planning to register from the start date until December 31st.

## DOI Service Fees for For‐profit Organizations

DOI Service Fees are based on the total annual revenue of the organization. The "Start‐up" category is for newly formed organizations and will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

## DOI Service Fees: Direct Member and Consortium Member

There are two different ways organizations can use DataCite’s DOI services: 1) as a **Direct Member** or 2) as a **Consortium Member**.

## Direct Member

A Direct Member is an organization that works with one or more repositories within the same administrative structure as the Direct Member. Each Direct Member pays an annual membership fee of 2000€ as well as the service fees.

## Consortium Member

A consortium is a group of organizations within one region or discipline that have come together to collectively participate in DataCite’s community and governance activities and use DataCite’s DOI services. A consortium is composed of five or more organizations that are under different administrative structures. Each consortium pays a single annual membership fee totaling 2000 euros. Each consortium organization within the consortium pays the organization fee and the DOI fee. 

One organization within the consortium is designated the consortium lead and fulfills a range of responsibilities. For-profit organizations cannot join a Consortium as Consortium Organization but they can lead a Consortium when needed. In this case, the for-profit fee structure applies to the organization's own account and the non-profit service fees apply to the non-profit organizations participating in the Consortium.

Please note that Consortium Organizations that expect to register more than 10.000 DOIs annually should transfer to Direct Membership within the following calendar year, or pay the additional membership fee (2.000 € annually) while remaining part of the consortium. This ensures that there is appropriate cost recovery based on the impact on cost drivers.

###    Consortium fee caps

In order to support growing consortia and the adoption within communities, the total consortium service fee (organization + DOI fee) is capped based on the number of organizations. The total cap is calculated based on the total number of organizations within the consortium:

 *  5-30 orgs: 1.000 € multiplied by total number of consortium organizations within the consortium
 *  31-60 orgs: 700 € multiplied by total number of consortium organizations within the consortium
 *  61-100 orgs: 600 € multiplied by total number of consortium organizations within the consortium
 *  101+ orgs: 500 € multiplied by total number of consortium organizations within the consortium

Please note that when the fee cap applies, consortia will be invoiced for new consortium organizations in line with the fee cap and not based on individual estimates.

## Platforms

Within the DataCite community, there are a number of organizations, e.g. technology providers, that provide platforms for deposition of research outputs. Preferably, this is done as part of our Registered Service Providers Program. 

Please note that when an organization:

  (i) Provides DOIs to other, external organizations.
  (ii) Allows organizations to manage their own instance of a (institutional) repository.
  (iii) Allows content to be deposited to a branded platform.
  (iv) Enables metadata curation by an external organization which is considered the publisher
  
  this organization should join as a Consortium Member. DOI services cannot be provided to external organizations under a Direct Membership or under a Consortium Organization.


## Payment Methods and Billing Cycle

Payments can be made either via bank wire transfer, check or credit card.

DataCite invoices annually at the beginning of the calendar year. Direct Members and Consortium Organizations that join DataCite during the calendar year will be charged, in the month after they joined, pro-rated fees based on the month joined. The DOI fee will be billed based on their DOI estimate for the first year. There will be no credit if you register less nor an additional charge if you register more DOIs. There is no refund is a Consortium Organization leaves the Consortium during the year. For Consortia where the fee cap applies, the invoice will be based on the relevant fee cap.

In case undisputed fee payments are late more than ninety (90) days, repository accounts will become temporarily inactive until the payments are made.
