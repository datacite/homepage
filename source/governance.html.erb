      Governed by our community and directed by statutes
    </h1>

    <p>
      The strength of DataCite is based on its active membership. DataCite is governed by its members and Executive
      Board directed by our statutes.

    <h1> DataCite Members
    </h1>

    <p>
      DataCite Members are the voting body of the organization. Membership is open to all entities that support
      DataCite’s data sharing mission. Members are governed by the statutes (the bylaws and operating procedures) of the
      organization. The statutes are developed, ratified, and approved by the members.

      Members meet annually (General Assembly) to approve DataCite’s revenue and expenditures, stand and/or vote for the
      Executive Board, guide DataCite’s strategy, put forth resolutions and modifying the association’s statutes.
      Members also participate in DataCite’s Steering and Working Groups and provide input on new member acquisition.

    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="container section-content">
    <h1>Executive Board</h1>
    <p>
      Along with DataCite’s members, the Executive Board is the governing body
      of the association. The Executive Board consists of a President, four
      Vice Presidents (one of them being the Deputy President) and a Treasurer.
      One member of the Executive Board is an ex-officio representative of the
      Business Office. Members of the Executive Board are elected by members at
      the annual General Assembly and serve for a period of two years.
