# <a name="head1"></a>Application Support Engineer

DataCite is a leading global non-profit organization that provides persistent identifiers (DOIs) for research outputs. DataCite was founded in 2009 to support the research community in identifying, locating, accessing, and citing research outputs with confidence. DataCite develops services that enable easier access to research and provide a way for researchers to share and get credit for the outputs they generate.

IGSN e.V. is an international, non-profit organization with more than 20 members, which has operated a central registration system for IGSNs since 2011. The IGSN is a globally unique and persistent identifier for physical samples. The core purpose of IGSN is to enable transparent and traceable connections between research activities and objects, including samples, collections, instruments, grants, data, publications, people and organizations. 

IGSN and DataCite have a common purpose, and are embarking on a partnership. The partnership brings years of experience across our organizations and communities to scale sample community engagement, develop sample identifier practice standards, and increase adoption globally. As part of this partnership, DataCite is looking to recruit Application Support Engineer to join the DataCite development team.

This role is primarily a technical support role to onboard IGSN allocating agents as DataCite members to use DataCite services. You will be handling technical queries from our members, analysis of problems, and technical guidance to members. There is also an element of development with fixes and improvements to our services. You will be part of the IGSN Partnership Steering Group and work closely with the Samples Community manager to provide guidance and best practices for using DataCite services.

This way, their outputs become discoverable and associated metadata is made available to the community.
