# <a name="head1"></a>Technical Community Manager

DataCite is a community-led organisation with a vision to connect research and identify knowledge. We have been providing the means to create, find, cite, connect, and use research through Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) across 50 countries globally since 2009. Organizations within the research community join DataCite as members to be able to assign DOIs to all their research outputs. This way, their outputs become discoverable and associated metadata is made available to the community. DataCite then develops additional services to improve the DOI management experience, making it easier for our members to connect and share their DOIs with the broader research ecosystem and to assess the use of their DOIs within that ecosystem. DataCite is an active participant in the research community and promotes data sharing and citation through community-building efforts and outreach activities.
