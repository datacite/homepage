# <a name="head1">Regional Engagement Specialists (remote)</a>

DataCite is an open infrastructure organization that aims  to transcend discipline and geographic boundaries.  During 2022, DataCite began to implement the next iteration of the [DataCite Strategic Plan](DataCite Strategic Plan). As part of the strategic plan implementation, we identified global adoption as a key cross-pillar theme -- which brings together focussed engagement, adoption and implementation strategies

In order to support the growth of DataCite's international community,  focussed regional support and engagement within lesser represented and emerging regions is needed. Through focused regional engagement activities across the different regions, DataCite would be better able to support equitable access to our infrastructure services, ensuring that researchers and research organizations globally have the opportunity to benefit from open infrastructure services.
