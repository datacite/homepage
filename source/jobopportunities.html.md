# Application Developer

DataCite is looking for a full-stack application developer to join the DataCite development team.

DataCite is a leading global non-profit organization that provides persistent identifiers (DOIs) for research. DataCite was founded in 2009 to support the research community in identifying, locating, accessing, and citing research outputs with confidence. DataCite develops services that enable easier access to research and provide a way for researchers to share and get credit for the outputs they generate. 

The DataCite development team has built and is maintaining most of the software that is running DataCite services, and all this software has been made openly available under a permissive open source license. The languages, frameworks, and tools the team is using are constantly evolving, adjusting to the needs of DataCite members, and evolving community practices. One focus of our current work is on implementing user-facing services with the help of GraphQL and React, and we are constantly improving our continuous integration and delivery workflows with tools such as Terraform. Jupyter notebooks are playing an increasingly important role in our work in the development team.

Part of the work for the application developer role involves helping with grant-funded work, including a [recently awarded a grant by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://makedatacount.org/2020/05/05/igniting-change-our-next-steps/) to further build out our service offerings regarding the processing and reporting of data usage metrics and data citations. Specifically, we will be building a bibliometrics dashboard that makes data citations and data usage metrics from DataCite members available in a central public place. 

DataCite is a fully remote organization with staff members currently in four European countries, and the position is suited for remote work from Europe or North America. Travel to meet with DataCite members and project partners is expected.
