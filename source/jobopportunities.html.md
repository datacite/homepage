# Adoption Manager DataCite/ROR

DataCite is a global non-profit organisation that provides persistent identifiers (DOIs) for research. DataCite was founded in 2009 to support the research community in identifying, locating, accessing, and citing research outputs with confidence. DataCite develops services that enable easier access to research and provide a way for researchers to share and get credit for the outputs they generate.

DataCite, Crossref and California Digital Library are responsible for coordinating the activities of the Research Organization Registry (ROR). Each organization provides input on decisions and overall strategy that support the growth and sustainability of ROR by engaging in outreach to funders, potential adopters, and other stakeholders in their respective networks. ROR is a community-led project to develop an open, sustainable, usable, and unique identifier for every research organization in the world.

DataCite is looking for an Adoption Manager, based in North America, to support efforts to expand both ROR and DataCite adoption:

* ROR: supporting those who are integrating ROR IDs/affiliation data in their systems and workflows, both in terms of technical integration and work with metadata like mapping identifiers to ROR or vice versa
* DataCite: engaging with new and existing members in the community, understanding their workflows, systems and guiding their implementation. This also includes working with service providers that enable DataCite member integrations

## Responsibilities

(1) Build strategies to drive adoption and technical implementation
* Identify and cultivate potential adopters and members
* Work on integrations between DataCite/ROR services and our community preferred platforms and services
* Track and follow-through with adoption promotion efforts
* Develop outreach content and demonstrate best practices

(2) Support current members and adopters
* Provide members and adopters with support and troubleshooting
* Build and maintain tools and documentation that meets the needs of key communities
* Organize meetings and webinars with those who have already adopted 

(3) Contribute to development and implementation of the overall outreach strategies
* Work with ROR and DataCite teams to develop and implement outreach strategies that support wider adoption
* Provide technical documentation and draft integration best practices.

(4) Measure impact of adoption and contribute to further development of the services
* Collect regular data/statistics on usage and other metrics as needed, including analyzing Crossref and DataCite metadata
* Collect user feedback for product teams
* Translate adopter needs into user stories

## Required Skills and Qualifications

* University degree
* Familiar with research infrastructure and open science landscape 
* Ability to work with small distributed teams across time zones
* Strong, compelling, and clear written, oral, and visual communication
* Self-motivated to succeed and take initiative and seek continuous improvement
* Experience in implementation of API and web services technologies


## Desirable Qualifications

* Outreach experience
* Data science skills
* Familiarity with product management
* Experience working in an international environment
* Comfortable working remotely

This is a fixed-term contract for 2 years. This position will be based in North America but most of the DataCite team is based in Europe. The ROR team is distributed across Europe and North America. This means that flexible work hours and regular travel will be expected.

# Application Developer

DataCite is looking for a full-stack application developer to join the DataCite development team.

DataCite is a leading global non-profit organization that provides persistent identifiers (DOIs) for research. DataCite was founded in 2009 to support the research community in identifying, locating, accessing, and citing research outputs with confidence. DataCite develops services that enable easier access to research and provide a way for researchers to share and get credit for the outputs they generate. 

The DataCite development team has built and is maintaining most of the software that is running DataCite services, and all this software has been made openly available under a permissive open source license. The languages, frameworks, and tools the team is using are constantly evolving, adjusting to the needs of DataCite members, and evolving community practices. One focus of our current work is on implementing user-facing services with the help of GraphQL and React, and we are constantly improving our continuous integration and delivery workflows with tools such as Terraform. Jupyter notebooks are playing an increasingly important role in our work in the development team.

Part of the work for the application developer role involves helping with grant-funded work, including a [recently awarded a grant by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://makedatacount.org/2020/05/05/igniting-change-our-next-steps/) to further build out our service offerings regarding the processing and reporting of data usage metrics and data citations. Specifically, we will be building a bibliometrics dashboard that makes data citations and data usage metrics from DataCite members available in a central public place. 

DataCite is a fully remote organization with staff members currently in four European countries, and the position is suited for remote work from Europe or North America. Travel to meet with DataCite members and project partners is expected. 

## Responsibilities

Develop full-stack product features in an open source software environment, including user-facing front-end services.

* Test, deploy, and monitor applications, and react to problems.
* Help with grant-funded work such as the recent grant by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation for the Make Data Count initiative.

## Required Qualifications

* Bachelor’s degree or higher in Computer Science or a related field.
* 3+ years of experience with Javascript, Ruby, Python and/or demonstration of development work across different languages and environments.
* Hands-on experience developing, deploying, and maintaining web applications, including system administration, error tracking, and support.
* Experience with project management and open source software development practices.
* Excellent English communication skills, and the flexibility that is needed for working in a small, distributed team.
* Strong and demonstrated interest in open science and data sharing.

## Desirable Qualifications

* Experience working with GraphQL and React.
* Experience working with Ruby on Rails.
* Experience working with AWS and Terraform.
* Experience working with Jupyter notebooks.
* Practical experience working with data citations and data usage metrics.

## To apply
