#### How do open PID services work together?

Providers of persistent identifier (PID) services collaborate to enable seamless scholarly communication. But what are they actually doing to realize this? How do PID service providers integrate other PIDs into their services? This open community session gives each PID service provider the opportunity to let us see scholarly communication through their eyes. Throughout the session you will be able to ask the PID service providers anything about their services.

Speakers: TBA

The session will be recorded and then made publicly available along with the slides.

#### DataCite Service Providers

Join this session to learn more about several of our registered service providers, including updates on upcoming new features.
