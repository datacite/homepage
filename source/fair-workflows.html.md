Implementing FAIR Workflows: A proof of concept study in the field of consciousness  is a 3-year, multi-partner project funded by the TWCF, aimed at building and implementing an exemplar FAIR and Open research workflow based on the reality of an entire research lifecycle. The project will produce a practical and easy to use guide for other scientists to improve the FAIRness of their own research.

## Project motivation

1. Papers only tell a small fraction of the story, hard to comprehensively evaluate a research study based on papers alone.
2. The complex experimental protocols and data in the field of neuroscience aggravate the reproducibility problems.
3. Open and FAIR research increase reproducibility and reuse, infrastructure and tools are available but adoption fragmented.
4. To motivate open practice adoption and FAIR compliance, researchers need concrete examples of FAIR workflows that are easy to implement.

## Project objectives

1. To create an end-to-end FAIR workflow specification.
2. To enable uptake through adoption and dissemination plans with best practices.
3. To implement credit tracing and evaluation support for the researchers through the PID graph based on citation and reuse data.
4. To attest the scientific rigor of the research study.
5. To enhance discoverability and reuse of the research outputs.

# Work packages

## 1. Workflow development

Develop a specification for an end-to-end FAIR workflow for researchers that enables tracking of all different components of a research project through PIDs and their metadata, make research outputs FAIR upon inception.

<table class="table pricing">
<thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Deliverable</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Lead</th>
<th>Output</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td>D1.1</td>
<td>Documentation of the end-to-end workflow specification, made publicly available with a registered DOI.</td>
<td>DataCite, MPIEA</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D1.2</td>
<td>Mid-term project report tracking progress and evaluation of research assets already captured in the PID Graph. </td>
<td>DataCite, MPIEA</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D1.3</td>
<td>Final project report tracking progress and evaluation of impact.</td>
<td>DataCite, MPIEA</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## 2. Application of workflow in research

Apply the end-to-end FAIR workflow specification to a pre-registered multi-modal  imaging experiment on consciousness to provide a proof of concept.
