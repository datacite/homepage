### 2. Site Visitors

Just by merely using this website for information purposes, DataCite, like most site operators, collects personal data of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the IP address, the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. DataCite’s purpose in collecting these information is to better understand how DataCite’s visitors use its sites.

Legal basis for the processing of these data is Art. 6 No. 1 lit. f GDPR.

DataCite will not attribute these data to specific persons, and these data will not be combined with other data sources. After use for the above purposes, the data are erased by DataCite after seven days.

### 3. General Treatment of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to DataCite’s sites can choose to interact with DataCite in ways that require DataCite to gather personal data. The amount and type of information that DataCite gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.

For example, we ask visitors who send a message to our Help Desk, requesting assistance, to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with DataCite – by becoming a member and using our DOI services, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, DataCite collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with DataCite. DataCite does not disclose personal data other than as described in the Protection of Information section below. Visitors can always refuse to supply personal data, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain activities.
