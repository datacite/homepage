# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is of critical importance to us, so at DataCite we have a few fundamental principles related to privacy. 

We don’t ask for personal information unless we truly need it.

We don’t share personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.

We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going business operations.

If you find content on the DataCite’s website, support site, or blog, that you believe violates our Privacy Policy, please contact us immediately at support@datacite.org.


### DataCite -- Website, Support Site, Blog, and Services


DataCite operates a website at [https://datacite.org/](https://datacite.org/), a support site at [https://support.datacite.org/](https://support.datacite.org/), blog at [https://blog.datacite.org/](https://blog.datacite.org/), Fabrica, a DOI service, at [https://doi.datacite.org/](https://doi.datacite.org/) and a Help Desk at [support@datacite.org](mailto:support@datacite.org). It is DataCite’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating these sites and services. If you have questions about deleting or correcting any personal data you find on our please contact our [support team](mailto:support@datacite.org). 



### Site Visitors

Like most site operators, DataCite collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. DataCite’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how DataCite’s visitors use its sites. 


### General Treatment of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to DataCite’s sites can choose to interact with DataCite in ways that require DataCite to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that DataCite gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. 

For example, we ask visitors who send a message to our [Help Desk](mailto:support@datacite.org), requesting assistance, to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with DataCite – by becoming a member and using our DOI services, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, DataCite collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with DataCite. DataCite does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described in the _Protection of Information_ section below. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain activities.


### Cookies


### A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. DataCite uses cookies to help DataCite identify and track visitors, their usage of DataCite’s sites.

DataCite visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using DataCite’s sites, with the drawback that certain features of DataCite’s sites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.


### DataCite Members

If you become a member of DataCite, we ask for contact information (name and email and billing address) to fulfill our business obligations -- contacts include service, technical, voting, and billing contacts. The service contact receives general information about service status and new services. The technical contact is notified of service changes and infrastructure outages.  The voting contact receives information pertaining to DataCite’s governance duties; board elections, statute changes, and budget approval. The billing contact receives annual invoices for membership and DOI service fees.  We log membership contact and billing information to our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, Salesforce. Salesforce fully [complies](https://www.salesforce.com/eu/campaign/gdpr/) with current privacy regulations.

Depending on the type of DataCite services used, your organization contact may receive, notifications about training sessions, webinars, product testing, or news that will impact the use of DataCite services. Individuals may remove themselves from mailings by following the unsubscribe link provided in every DataCite email.


### Fabrica 

Fabrica is DataCite’s service used by DataCite members to create and assign DOIs and associated metadata. The service relies on cookies for use. Fabrica is not a public facing service and those using Fabrica must have an account. Fabrica also collects information about users of the service, including names and emails. This information is used to administer the service. 


### Support Site 

DataCite maintains a [support site](https://support.datacite.org/) to help the DataCite community understand and use our services. All of DataCite’s support content is on readme.io platform. readme.io fully [complies](https://readme.io/gdpr/) with current privacy regulations.


### DataCite’s Metadata and Identifiers

As part of our services of registering DOIs, we also collect associated metadata. All of DataCite’s metadata and Identifiers registered with DataCite are made available for reuse without restriction through our public APIs and search interfaces. We are open and transparent about the use of our identifiers and metadata. 

DataCite also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. DataCite only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described in the _Protection of Information_ section below. 

If you are a consumer of our metadata and identifiers and identify yourself in API queries using your account credentials, we will not store or use your email for any other purpose than technical troubleshooting and only if absolutely necessary. You may choose not to use your account credentials for API queries of public content, which won’t identify you at all. More information can be found in our REST API documentation.


### Using Datacite’s Help Desk

If you send a message to our [Help Desk](mailto:support@datacite.org) a “ticket” along with your email will be logged in our ticketing system, Frontapp. DataCite will not use contact information to resolve questions and any details provided during a support conversation are kept private. From time to time DataCite will add your email to an appropriate mailing list for additional information. Individuals may remove themselves from mailings by following the unsubscribe link provided in every DataCite email. Frontapp fully [complies](https://help.frontapp.com/t/m22vyb/is-front-compliant-with-gdpr) with current privacy regulations.

### Email Communications

DataCite uses email to communicate with DataCite members and users of our services. Email is either personal interaction or via Google Groups.

### Protection of Information
