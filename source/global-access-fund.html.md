# Global Access Fund


The Global Access Fund (GAF) was established to enable organizations worldwide to make their research outputs discoverable. It will provide financial support for outreach activities and infrastructure development to enable organizations in underrepresented regions to benefit from DataCite infrastructure services. The GAF is part of the [DataCite Global Access Program (GAP)](https://datacite.org/global-access-program.html) made possible by grant Grant 2022-316573 from the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/). 

## Scope (What we fund):

The Global Access Fund will allocate funding to projects in the following areas:

#### (1) **Outreach  and engagement activities** to support increasing awareness and adoption of global and local solutions and connect to community initiatives, such as:
- Capacity building to deliver training to research administrators and librarians on open infrastructure and service fundamentals (DOIs, metadata, APIs), implementation (e.g. DataCite API integration in a repository and other systems, metadata curation) and demonstrating the value of the connection to local infrastructure services to the community.
- Events (Webinars, workshops, virtual communication campaigns) to promote open infrastructure, discuss and amplify membership and adoption strategies and plans leveraging local initiatives.
- Outreach resource development to deliver content (videos, social media content, podcast, tutorials, etc.) that document use cases, success stories, and benefits of DataCite infrastructure in local/regional contexts. Preference would be given to innovative formats and materials in languages other than English.


#### (2) **Open Infrastructure development and integration** to enable and increase the adoption of DataCite infrastructure and related services, such as:

- Repository, publishing, and other system development and implementation to allow organizations to integrate DataCite APIs and metadata 
- DataCite API integrations to connect local and national systems with the DataCite Registry
- Development of new tools and systems to obtain additional value from our infrastructure (e.g. visualizations, statistics tools, metadata enrichment tools, CRIS systems, etc.) . 

## Eligibility (Who can apply):

- Representatives of non-profit stakeholders within the research ecosystem (e.g. research institutions, associations, NRENs, government bodies, service providers, etc.) based in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia can apply. Applicants should be authorized to apply on behalf of their organization (legal entity).
- Applications are open to DataCite member and non-member organizations.
