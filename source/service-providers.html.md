# What is a DataCite Service Provider?

A Service Provider is an organization that has integrated with one of the DataCite APIs to enable other organizations to register DataCite DOIs. DataCite Service Providers do not offer DOIs, but do offer the ability to register DOIs through their platform, using a memberâ€™s own log-in credentials.
