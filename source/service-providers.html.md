# What is a DataCite Service Provider?

A DataCite Registered Service Provider provides software that integrates with a DataCite API in order to allow DataCite Members to register DOIs using each Memberâ€™s own DataCite API credentials.

Registered Service Providers meet requirements and follow best practices to ensure that their integrations register DOIs correctly and support creation of high-quality metadata.

Interested in becoming a registered Service Provider? Learn more about the [Service Provider Program](/service-provider-program.html).

Interested in using an integration supported by one our registered Service providers? Learn more about [Service Provider Software Integrations](https://support.datacite.org/docs/service-provider-software-integrations) on the DataCite support site.
