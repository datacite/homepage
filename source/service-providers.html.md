# What is a DataCite Service Provider?

A DataCite Registered Service Provider provides software that integrates with a DataCite API in order to allow DataCite Members to register DOIs using each Memberâ€™s own DataCite API credentials.

Registered Service Providers meet requirements and follow best practices to ensure that their integrations register DOIs correctly and support creation of high-quality metadata.
