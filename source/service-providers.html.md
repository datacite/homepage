# What is a DataCite Service Provider?

A DataCite Registered Service Provider is an organization that has integrated with one of the DataCite APIs in order to allow existing DataCite Members to register DOIs using that Member's own log-in credentials. A CRIS or a repository platform are both examples of a Service Provider.

In order to be listed as a Registered Service Provider, an organization must [apply](https://formstack.io/F45B4) and must meet [essential requirements](/service-provider-program.html).
